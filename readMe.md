## Overview

The Kruskal Algorithm Visualizer is a Java Swing application that allows users to input graph data, visualize the Kruskal algorithm's execution, and view the resulting Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). This tool provides a hands-on way to understand how the Kruskal algorithm works and visualize its output.

## Features

- **Graph Creation:** Users can input nodes, edges, and edge weights to create a graph visually.

- **Algorithm Visualization:** The application visually guides users through the steps of the Kruskal algorithm, highlighting the edges considered and those included in the MST.

- **Table Display:** Once the MST is computed, the tool displays a table with the edges in the MST and their corresponding weights, as well as the total cost of the MST.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- NetBeans or another Java IDE for running the application.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Open in NetBeans:**

Open the project in NetBeans or your preferred Java development environment.

3. **Build and Run:**

Build the project and run the application.

4. **Input Graph Data:**

Enter the graph data as prompted (nodes, edges, weights).

5. **Visualize MST:**

Start the visualization, and the application will guide you through the Kruskal algorithm's steps.
